💡 **Problem 1 - OCD Severity Analysis**

Can Lifestyle and Family History Predict OCD Severity?

🧠 Project Overview
This project analyzes how education level, marital status, and family history impact OCD severity (measured using Y-BOCS scores). The goal is to identify high-risk patient groups and uncover behavioral patterns using SQL + Tableau.

📌 Metric Tracked
Y-BOCS Total Score
Sum of Obsession + Compulsion scores used to quantify OCD severity.

🧭 Key Dimensions
Marital Status: Single, Married, Divorced
Education Level: High School, Some College, College Degree, Graduate Degree
Family History of OCD: Yes / No
Depression / Anxiety: Comorbid diagnosis
Medications: Usage indicator

📊 Insights
📈 Single patients with some college education had the highest average OCD severity (42.62).
💬 Married individuals with graduate degrees showed the lowest severity (36.52), suggesting social or emotional support benefits.
🧩 Lifestyle factors can significantly influence OCD outcomes, indicating potential for more tailored interventions.

**💡 Problem 2 – OCD Comorbidities by Compulsion Patterns**

Are Certain Compulsions More Tied to Depression or Anxiety?

🧠 Project Overview
This analysis explores the relationship between OCD compulsion types and the presence of comorbid depression or anxiety. By using SQL + Tableau, the project uncovers which compulsions are most psychologically intense and identifies high-impact subgroups.

📌 Metrics Tracked
Patient Count by Compulsion Type
Comorbidity Count: Number of patients with Depression Diagnosis & Number of patients with Anxiety Diagnosis

🧭 Key Dimensions
Compulsion Type: Checking, Counting, Washing, Ordering, Praying
Depression Diagnosis: Yes / No
Anxiety Diagnosis: Yes / No
Optional Filters: Gender, Family History of OCD, Duration

<img width="1257" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c92a1163-9fc5-44fe-b22a-8fa40b699c50" />


📊 Insights
🧠 Washing and Counting compulsions show the strongest overlap with both depression and anxiety.
😟 Praying and Ordering have lower overall patient counts but still reflect substantial comorbid rates.
💡 High-risk patterns suggest certain compulsions may emotionally exhaust patients faster, calling for targeted mental health support.

📈 Visual Highlights

Interactive filters to slice by demographics and comorbid indicators

✅ Use Case: Supports early screening strategies by surfacing which compulsions require more holistic mental health evaluation (beyond just OCD symptoms).

**💡 Problem 3 – Obsession Loops: Do Certain Obsessions Always Lead to Certain Compulsions?**

Can we identify patterns where specific obsessions are strongly linked to certain compulsions?

🧠 Project Overview
This analysis investigates whether particular OCD obsessions consistently lead to specific compulsions. By joining and aggregating the data, it uncovers behavioral loops — repeated patterns that define how patients respond to intrusive thoughts.

📌 Metrics Tracked
Frequency of Obsession–Compulsion pairs
Co-occurrence counts per combination

🧭 Key Dimensions
Obsession Type
Compulsion Type

📊 Insights
🔁 Certain obsessions (e.g., Contamination) are consistently tied to specific compulsions (e.g., Washing).
🧠 These loops reflect core behavioral pathways, helping therapists design tailored interventions.
📉 Loops with the highest frequency may signal automatic behavioral responses.

**💡 Problem 4 – Time vs. Trauma: Does Duration Always Equal Severity?**
Do patients with longer OCD symptoms always have higher severity, or do some suffer heavily in a short time?

🧠 Project Overview
This project compares duration of OCD symptoms with Y-BOCS scores to understand if time directly reflects trauma. The goal is to uncover outliers — short-duration patients with severe symptoms and long-duration patients with lower scores.

📌 Metric Tracked
Y-BOCS Total Score
Duration of Symptoms (months)

🧭 Key Dimensions
Depression Diagnosis (color coded)
Medication Use
Y-BOCS Subscores

<img width="1262" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abd9bf65-41b1-4cbc-a83f-c6c081b0b112" />

📊 Insights
📉 Many patients with short symptom durations still report high OCD severity, especially if untreated.
💬 Duration isn’t always a predictor of mental burden — early interventions matter.
🎯 Spotting short-term, high-severity cases helps address trauma quickly.

**💡 Problem 5 – Who Are the Silent Sufferers?**
Can we identify patients with low Y-BOCS scores but hidden psychological strain?

🧠 Project Overview
This analysis identifies patients whose OCD severity seems low, but who still experience high mental health impacts via comorbid depression/anxiety or intense compulsions. These are potential “missed” cases — patients who may fall through the cracks.

📌 Metric Tracked
Y-BOCS Total < 30 (filtered)
Comorbid conditions: Depression or Anxiety Diagnosis

🧭 Key Dimensions
Depression / Anxiety Diagnosis
Compulsion Intensity (proxy)
Family History of OCD

<img width="1257" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f3f0714-c090-4312-a4ab-d587b9924dc3" />


📊 Insights
🚩 Several patients with low Y-BOCS scores still show significant psychological burden.
🧩 These patients could be overlooked if only severity is used for diagnosis.
💡 Insight supports holistic care models beyond traditional scoring.

**🧠 Final Thoughts**

This project goes beyond basic severity scores to explore the complex layers of OCD — from how lifestyle and education shape patient outcomes to identifying “silent sufferers” who risk being overlooked by traditional metrics.

Through SQL exploration and Tableau visualization, we uncovered:
Hidden risk groups based on marital/education factors
Strong ties between specific compulsions and psychological strain
Patterns of obsession-compulsion loops that can inform treatment
Outliers where time and trauma don’t align
Low-score patients still carrying heavy mental health burdens

These insights can support more personalized care, early detection, and compassionate intervention strategies. The power of analytics lies not just in what we can measure — but in what we can reveal.
