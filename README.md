ðŸ’¡ **Problem Statement 1 - OCD Severity Analysis**

Can Lifestyle and Family History Predict OCD Severity?

ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project analyzes how education level, marital status, and family history impact OCD severity (measured using Y-BOCS scores). The goal is to identify high-risk patient groups and uncover behavioral patterns using SQL + Tableau.

ðŸ“Œ Metric Tracked
Y-BOCS Total Score
Sum of Obsession + Compulsion scores used to quantify OCD severity.

ðŸ§­ Key Dimensions
Marital Status: Single, Married, Divorced
Education Level: High School, Some College, College Degree, Graduate Degree
Family History of OCD: Yes / No
Depression / Anxiety: Comorbid diagnosis
Medications: Usage indicator

ðŸ“Š Insights
ðŸ“ˆ Single patients with some college education had the highest average OCD severity (42.62).
ðŸ’¬ Married individuals with graduate degrees showed the lowest severity (36.52), suggesting social or emotional support benefits.
ðŸ§© Lifestyle factors can significantly influence OCD outcomes, indicating potential for more tailored interventions.

**ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement 2 â€“ OCD Comorbidities by Compulsion Patterns**

Are Certain Compulsions More Tied to Depression or Anxiety?

ðŸ§  Project Overview
This analysis explores the relationship between OCD compulsion types and the presence of comorbid depression or anxiety. By using SQL + Tableau, the project uncovers which compulsions are most psychologically intense and identifies high-impact subgroups.

ðŸ“Œ Metrics Tracked
Patient Count by Compulsion Type
Comorbidity Count: Number of patients with Depression Diagnosis & Number of patients with Anxiety Diagnosis

ðŸ§­ Key Dimensions
Compulsion Type: Checking, Counting, Washing, Ordering, Praying
Depression Diagnosis: Yes / No
Anxiety Diagnosis: Yes / No
Optional Filters: Gender, Family History of OCD, Duration

ðŸ“Š Insights
ðŸ§  Washing and Counting compulsions show the strongest overlap with both depression and anxiety.
ðŸ˜Ÿ Praying and Ordering have lower overall patient counts but still reflect substantial comorbid rates.
ðŸ’¡ High-risk patterns suggest certain compulsions may emotionally exhaust patients faster, calling for targeted mental health support.

ðŸ“ˆ Visual Highlights

Color-coded comparison of: Total patients | With Depression | With Anxiety

Interactive filters to slice by demographics and comorbid indicators

âœ… Use Case: Supports early screening strategies by surfacing which compulsions require more holistic mental health evaluation (beyond just OCD symptoms).
